👋 Hello, I'm a student at SAYNA. It's a digital school to learn all digital professions.
👀 I'm interested in coding but I'm not a developer, sorry!
🌱 I'm learning all about development and especially how to learn it.
💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on many projects to see all the methodical development in the world.
